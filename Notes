open git bash and reach to the current directory
to initialize git, use command- git init
t regularly track a working directory , we require a staging area
to know whether it is tracked the changes by git , we use command- git status.

if it shows your file to untracked then do this- git add chapter1.txt
and if you want to add whole directory , not just one by one then use command - git add .

to end and save all the edit , use command-
git commit -m "complete chapter1"

to see what changes you made , use command- git log 

3 stages- working directory , staging area and finqlly git repository-
so we add files in staging area by git add. , and them git commit  it , the reason is so as to cluster ot which is 
required and which is not.
and if any mishaps found then we use the command- git checkout , to go back to the directory. or torch the whole updated file

command- git diff chapter3.txt   is used to checkout the difference between the precious one and the updated one.

command to push the git repository-
"git push -u origin main"
before check this -
"git log"

here from the git repository we push all the information to the remote repository. here our remote repository is github.

DS store file is a default file which is present in every project , having settings in it.
we can see the hiddenfile of our project by command-
"ls -a "
gitignore  files are igbored files which you cant view or download from others project, it contains API/ PASSKEY 
etc.

git clone "filename "  is the command to copy all the github files on our computer. now that is your file and you are able to make any sort of changes to it.
