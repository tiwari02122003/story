open git bash and reach to the current directory
to initialize git, use command- git init
t regularly track a working directory , we require a staging area
to know whether it is tracked the changes by git , we use command- git status.

if it shows your file to untracked then do this- git add chapter1.txt
and if you want to add whole directory , not just one by one then use command - git add .

to end and save all the edit , use command-
git commit -m "complete chapter1"

to see what changes you made , use command- git log
